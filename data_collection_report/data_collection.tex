\section{How you obtained your data?}

We obtained the base of our data from a dataset published on \href{https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset}{Kaggle}. The dataset contained information on $\sim5000$ movies. We essentially used this dataset for the movie list and the IMDB IDs. From the IMDB IDs we were able to perform requests to the  \href{https://www.omdbapi.com/}{OMDB API} where we compiled the title, plot summary, and genres for all 5000 movies. From there we stored them in a JSON file, with each entry containing the fields ['title', 'plot', 'genres'].

\section{Data Size}
How large is your data?

\section{Format/Storage}
In what format are you storing your data. Describe the abstract data type, not just the file format.

\section{Processing}
Did you need to process the original data to get it into an easier, more compressed format (e.g., convert from one format to another one)?

\section{Simulating Similar Data}
How would you simulate similar data?
